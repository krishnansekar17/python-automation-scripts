   - Evaluate the recency, coverage, authority, and completeness of the available internal data.
   - Assign scores (0-1) for each dimension.

   - Focus on authoritative educational sources.

3. Information Synthesis:
   - Combine old data with the latest web search results to generate a final answer.
